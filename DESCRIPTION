Description: This model was developed during the PhD work of Yangfan Liu, under supervision of Carsten Thure kirkeby, Lene Jung Kj√¶r, 
    and Anette Elle Boklund of the University of Copenhagen. This folder contains three subfolders namely Data, Model_scripts, and R; 1. The 
    Data folder includes the model inputs and parameters as well as assistant shapefiles and required packages, 2. The Model_scripts 
    folder performs the prediction of bird abundance and preparation of the main HPAI transmission model, and the visulization and quantification of simulated
    outputs. 3. The R folder contains the core model scripts. Moreover, users can perform simulations with the provided model inputs or their own inputs, such as the updated Danish 
    wild bird abundance.
